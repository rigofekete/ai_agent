# Python AI Code-Fixing Agent

**A small, security-conscious AI agent that analyzes Python repositories, detects bugs, and proposes or applies fixes.**

---

## Description

This project is an experimental AI-powered assistant that brings **agentic IDE-like features** into a simple Python tool.  
It uses an LLM with tool calling to:

- Parse and summarize project context (files, errors, tests)  
- Generate targeted patches and refactors  
- Run tests and linting to validate changes  
- Iterate until errors are resolved  

It’s inspired by features found in editors like Cursor, Zed, and Claude Code — but implemented from scratch for educational purposes.

## Features

- **Modular tool interface** (file read/write, test runner, shell sandbox)  
- **Deterministic prompts** and configurable model/provider  
- **Extensible design**: add new tools, swap LLMs, tweak prompts/strategies
